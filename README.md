# Remote_control
The program enables a 3-wheel bot to follow a certain color or be controlled from a laptop. A standard 4-wheel bot was converted from being controled by IR remote to Wifi control. Made possible by installing a Wi-fi module on the bot. Additional Modifications include installing a camera on the bot and displaying it on the laptop screen leading to first-person POV. Color Detection through OpenCV was then fed data from the camera so that the bot can follow a certain color. Code for the camera was not included as it was the given code by the manufacturer and only the IP address is the only thing that needs to be edited in the code.
